Python program applications that perform specified tasks, December 09 2023 by Abdul Esmail

## Description

These are Python program applications for various tasks. There are three projects at hand here each with various tasks;

## Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time:

The python code defines a function which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input. The task of the python code is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

## Two Numbers are Postive:

The python code defines a function which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

## Consonant Value :

Here the python code Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

## How to use Requirments:

A Computer
